          The emotional disconnect that families experience with loved ones with Alzheimerâ€™s disease is incredibly painful, and I know this firsthand.
          My grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer's when I was five years old, and because of that, I never had the relationship that I wanted to have 
          with him. The disconnect I felt with my grandfather was hard as a child, and it stayed with me long after his passing. This feeling of disconnect 
          inspired me to find a way to help families reconnect to loved ones with Alzheimer's disease, and that idea is Nostalgia Therapy. I hope that it can help 
          you and your family reconnect to a loved one.
